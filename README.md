### Abstract 

The problem of dynamic segmentation consists in finding the segments in which the individuals of a population must be grouped in different periods of time, taking into account that, as time passes, the general characteristics of the population will be changing, and therefore the segments must be evolving through time. In the literature, diverse techniques have been proposed to achieve the effect of obtaining segments that change through time. However, these techniques have not focused on balancing correctly the importance between past and present information. In this study, a new dynamic segmentation technique is proposed, which observes past behaviors to weight the importance of the variables in a clustering technique and uses the real values of the observations for the current period to find the clusters and to obtain a better segmentation. In addition, an alternative robust version of the proposed dynamic segmentation technique is presented, where some changes are made to have a better performance in presence of case-wise and cell-wise outliers. The performance of both proposals introduced in this work are compared with classical and recent techniques introduced in the literature, in simulated and real datasets with and without outliers. Results show that, for data without outliers, the proposed non-robust dynamic segmentation technique usually outperforms the other dynamic segmentation techniques, but when outliers are included in the dataset, the robust version of the proposed dynamic segmentation techniques outperforms both the non-robust version and the other techniques presented in the literature.
